# Milestone II

https://travel-app-lf85.onrender.com/home

Team Omega Î©
Project by Edward Manansala and Samantha StaAna
Run "npm run dev" on root. It would run both frontend and backend(mongoDB) concurrently.
Local: http://localhost:3000

Originally from repo https://github.com/Dyamez/tourApp 9/4/23 with 48 commits on 2 branches.
Due to file size error by github, migrated the project here @ https://github.com/Dyamez/Travel_App
changes: cd/change directory/go into the /frontend folder, then from the VSCode terminal, run 'npm -i -y'. Same goes to modify the /backend folder. Go Back to root directory, run npm i, then start the project with "npm run dev"

Issues: 8/29
