https://travel-app-lf85.onrender.com

Render may take a while at times to start serving the project webpage.

## Team Omega Ω

Run "npm run dev" on root. It would run both frontend and backend(mongoDB) concurrently.

Local: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Pre-Requisite:

'npm' must first be installed on all three folders.

cd/change directory then go into the /frontend or /backend folder. From the VSCode terminal, run 'npm -i -y' all folders, root, frontend and backend for it to work.

On the root directory, run 'npm run dev'.

.env file needed for backend to set PORT & MONGODB_URI. Not uploaded with repo for security reasons.

on root, if 'npm run dev' does not work, run 'npm i -d concurrently' & 'npm i -d nodemon'.

Issues: 8/29
